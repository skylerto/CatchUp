CatchUp
=======

CatchUp is an Electron app to manage developer talks.

# Why

Quite often I find myself on public transit without wifi. Like a good developer I love to watch/listen to conference talks about various topics. Rarely do I find myself actually downloading the material so that I may listen to it while I'm taking public transit, this is a solution to help me to manage the talks I have listen to as well as the talks that I would like to listen to!
