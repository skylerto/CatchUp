Glazba
=======

Glazba (Music) is an Electron app to manage developer talks.

## Why

Quite often I find myself on public transit without wifi. Like a good developer I love to watch/listen to conference talks about various topics. Rarely do I find myself actually downloading the material so that I may listen to it while I'm taking public transit, this is a solution to help me to manage the talks I have listen to as well as the talks that I would like to listen to!


## Usage

Checkout the [releases](https://github.com/skylerto/Glazba/releases) page, or ...

1. Download/clone
2. npm install .
3. npm start
4. type in a url
5. hit the download button
6. listen to the talk
